## Monitoring Covid-19

This is a python program of monitoring COVID-19 cases of the World, Vietnam, and Finland.

The users can choose to show data of COVID-19 of the world, Vietnam, England or Finland. This prompts the data and also the differences, which means which one increases or decreases with negative sign, between shown data and the data stored in the {country name/world}.info file, instead of the previous stored data.

According to the API, the recovered data of UK is not retrieved, so it will be shown as null.

Users can also use the code as template to build a program for the country of their own interest.

The original time will be displayed in your local time zone. Make sure to change the time zone phrase GMT+{time zone}

If you are using repl.it, the local time will be in accordance with GMT+0.
